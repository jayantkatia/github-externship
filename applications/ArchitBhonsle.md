[Jump straight to my proposal](#archits-application-to-the-upptime-github-externship)

# About Me

Hi! I'm Archit. I am primarily as web developer with React, Node.js and
Mongodb with exprience in Typescript`for the same stack. I've also worked with
Svelte before in a small personal project. I've also worked on machine learning
using Scikit-learn, Tensorflow and Pytorch and mobile apps using Flutter and
React-native.

I can't convey how excited I am on getting an opportunity to work on an actual
Svelte application instead of small personal projects I've been spinning up.
I've done two internships before this, one dealing with vanilla HTML, CSS and
JavaScript and the other with React.

Most of my experience is in React:

- [e-commerce-react](https://github.com/ArchitBhonsle/e-commerce-react) was
  my first React project with the course I was doing to learn it. It is
  live [here](https://asb-e-commerce-react.herokuapp.com/).
- [habit-tracker-react-ts](https://github.com/ArchitBhonsle/habit-tracker-react-ts),
  a habit tracker in React project using Typescript.
- [meditatree](https://github.com/ArchitBhonsle/meditatree), a (failed üòù)
  attempt to try and use React-Three-Fiber to create a 3D experience in the
  browser with Three.js to help users meditate.
- [mnist-explorer](https://github.com/ArchitBhonsle/mnist-explorer), an app
  that aims to demonstrate the power of machine learning using the MNIST
  dataset for handwritten digit recognition using TensorFlow.js and React. This
  project is live [here](https://mnist-explorer.herokuapp.com/).
- [event-management-admin](https://github.com/ArchitBhonsle/event-management-admin),
  a proper full stack application in MERN to create an admin panel using
  Chakra UI for the UI library and SWR to make the requests.

Well that's a lot React. Other than that some other things I've worked on are:

- [inventory-management](https://github.com/ArchitBhonsle/inventory-management).
  This is a project I worked on with my friend and I worked on for a hackathon.
  Although, the front-end is made in React I was responsible for creating the
  Node.js server in Typescript and exposing a Graphql API using
  Apollo Server Express.
- [smart-pulseox](https://github.com/ArchitBhonsle/smart-pulseox) a mobile
  app in Flutter to communicates with an Arduino equipped with the
  appropriate sensors to display one's heart rate and blood oxygen levels and
  relays this information to a server.
- [cgol-wasm](https://github.com/ArchitBhonsle/cgol-wasm). Conway's Game of
  Life in the browser accelerated by WebAssembly. Although some part of the
  application is done using Javascript, the core functionality is
  implemented using Rust compiled to WebAssembly. It is hosted
  [here](https://architbhonsle.github.io/cgol-wasm/).
- [wasml](https://github.com/ArchitBhonsle/wasml) or WebAssembly powered
  Machine Learning. This is a project I plan to make the "face" of my resume.
  It's aims to assist the entire machine learning process from data ingestion
  to model deployment.

Aside from coding my hobbies include spending way too much time on
[my vim, emacs and fish configs](https://github.com/ArchitBhonsle/dotfiles),
maintaining my 375 day (as of 18/05/2021) Duolingo streak in Japanese and argue
with friends my on why Fedora is better and cry on the inside evertime I can't
play a game because Steam Play is still experimental or I can't
`ctrl+c ctrl+shift+v` instructions from StackOverflow or Github cause they are
for Ubuntu.

# Archit's application to the Upptime GitHub Externship

Instead of one big proposal, I believe these two smaller proposals would cause a
larger impact.

## Sapper to SvelteKit

So one of my proposals is migrating the [upptime status page](https://github.com/upptime/status-page)
from Sapper to [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). Sapper, I believe has been
officially deprecated in favor of SvelteKit. Rich Harris, the creator of Svelte
in his latest talk on the Svelte Summit 2021 this April clarified his
position that SvelteKit is the way forward. Although it's still not hit `1.*.*`
it's pretty much ready and should be launched by the end of this externship.
I've been eyeing the release of SvelteKit from October 2020 when it was first
announced to create my personal landing page and it would be amazing to work
with [Anand Chowdhary](https://github.com/AnandChowdhary) who seems to be the
primary author for the upptime status page and has experience both in building
amazing tools like upptime and running a business.

Of course, I plan to add any and all features that may come up, most
importantly, dark mode üòé. A small UI touch-up and better graphs I believe would
also help in improving the user experience. The graphs are currently done using
Chart.js, I think D3 would be a better library to opt for in the long run.

## Chrome Extension

My second proposal would be a chrome (and hopefully a firefox) extension.
Instead of opening a separate website I think a browser extension would be more
convenient. It will give a reduced but quick overview of the information
displayed on the corresponding website. Of course, for a better view of the data
visiting the website would be needed. This extension would also be made in
Svelte and use D3 for charts.

# Misc

Although I personally like to divvy up my work based on milestones achieved
rather than hours worked, I think could work about 10-15 hours a week, mostly
concentrated towards the weekends. I believe this should give me enough time
to complete my proposed task. However, if I do fall behind on my assigned
milestones I would definitely go beyond the aforementioned time "limit" to
stay within the timeframe allotted.
