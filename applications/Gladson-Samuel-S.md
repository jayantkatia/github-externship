# About me

Hey there! I'm Gladson third year Computer Science Student at KITS. Recently, I started learning web development. I like to explore new stuff and fix bugs along the way. I am fairly decent with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, github REST API and firebase. I have worked with them for my small personal projects.

## Some of my recent projects

- [Todolist with firebase and React](https://github.com/Gladson-Samuel-S/Tasklist)
- [Spotify API ( Authorization and fetching data )](https://github.com/Gladson-Samuel-S/Playing-with-spotify-api)

# Issue

After some time playing on the dev tools I found out a padding issue on the nav bar's Github link on some mobile devices

![Responsive Nav bar link issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74543240/118851774-bfd47b00-b8ef-11eb-9d97-01da84af7427.png)

This could be solved by reducing the padding from 2rem to 1rem in the media query
in the file [client-04be1abb.css](https://github.com/upptime/upptime/blob/gh-pages/client/client-04be1abb.css)

# Proposal

- I think we could improve the 404 page with a better looking UI.
- Overall I like [Uptime](https://github.com/upptime/upptime). I think it is an effective usage of GitHub actions.
- I will be eager to learn the new stack and make myself comfortable with it soon.
- I will be working around 15 - 20 hours per week even more if required.
