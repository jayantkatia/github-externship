# Gunish's application to the Upptime GitHub Externship

Hello, world! My name is Gunish and I want to apply to this externship because...I want to make use of my existing skills and contribute to open source development. I can learn new skills and improve my communication skills, can interact with new people and learn a lot from them. Since I am a beginner in Open Source Development Github Externship can help me deep dive into world of Open Source.



ideas: I can work on fixing out the existing issues and can come up with new ideas once I become familiar with the code and how things work.

time-commitment : I can dedicate 10 to 12 hours per week.
