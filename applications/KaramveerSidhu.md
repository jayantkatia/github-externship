# Karamveer's application to the Upptime GitHub Externship

Hello, world! My name is Karamveer and I want to apply to this externship because it is one of the best ways to get hands-on experience. I will get an opportunity to work on a very important buisness application - Uptime monitoring. I will also be able to interact and learn from one of the best industry leaders, Anand Chowdhary. I am also proficient in most of the tech stack that the project uses and will be able to contribute well to the project. 

# My Skills
I mostly use PERN Stack. 

- **Web Technologies:** HTML5, CSS3, React, Node.js
- **Languages:** Javascript, C++, Python
- **Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL
- **Cloud:** AWS, Heroku, Netlify

# Ideas

- There are a couple of [top feature requests](https://github.com/upptime/upptime/discussions/categories/ideas?discussions_q=is%3Aunanswered+sort%3Atop+category%3AIdeas). I plan on implementing as much as possible. 
- There are also 26 open [issues](https://github.com/upptime/upptime/issues) and most of them are bugs. I plan on solving them too.
- Since the name of Koj is changed, Upptime can be made more Pabio specific that can help in generating leads for Pabio.
- Researching and improving the UX while using the Upptime app.
- Writing more blogs to increase reach and users, and improve documentation wherever needed.

# Time

I have planned on devoting 20-30 productive hrs per week but can increment as much as needed according to the needs of the project.

I am open to healthy discussion with Anand Chowdhary and everyone else contributing to the project to discuss in detail and carry out the requirements of the project.
