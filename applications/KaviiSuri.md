# Kavii's application to the Upptime GitHub Externship

Hi! My name is Kavii Suri and I want to apply to this externship to contribute back to the Open Source Community which has helped me a lot through my journey. I also want to work on my skills and improve them as I beleive in applying engineering skills to solve real world problems. 

## About me
I am very passionate about engineering and solving problems with my skills. I have been working as a freelance fullstack developer for about 1 year now, I have expirience in building production apps in ReactJS Mongodb Nodejs Express and JS. I love learning new things and am also a quick learner and have done some practice projects with Svelte and VueJS. 

## Ideas for Koj - Upptime

Here are the few ideas I came up with-
* An analytics dashboard that shows recent upptime data visualized using graphs and charts.
* Ability to export these "reports" as pdf using multiple color schemes / styles and share them.
* A "check now" feature that lets the user check the status of the application right away and this data is included with the periodically recorded data.

## Plan of Action / Tools to be used
* The dashboard can be built using D3.js or a similar charting library that integrates well with the preexisting codebase.
* The pdf export feature can be done either using the browsers normal `window.print` behaviour with 'print stylesheets' or by using Puppeteer library
* The check now feature can easily be implemented using preexisting codebase by just adding a button and relevant handler. 

Other than these, I would also love to work on preexisting ideas and problems that are needed to be solved.
