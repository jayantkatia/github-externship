# Nishidh's application for Upptime GitHub Externship

## About Me

Hello, I am Nishidh Jain and I am a passionate web developer who loves to develop clean, attractive, and responsive websites. I have knowledge of HTML/CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, ReactJS, and NextJS. I have good knowledge of working with different APIs like GitHub API, TMDB API which I have used in creating projects. This will be a very good opportunity for me in implementing my skills and learning new technologies by contributing to your organization. I have knowledge of JavaScript and ReactJS from lot of my personal projects so, learning Svelte will be easy for me, and implementing it in a project will give me a better understanding of it.

## Some of my projects

[Job Dundho](https://jobdundho.com/):-
This website can help to find jobs and internships easily for users. We gather the data from different websites and display that data on our website so that users do not have to navigate to different websites and can find jobs in one place. I have contributed to developing the frontend of this website using ReactJS.

[GitHub User Dashboard](https://github-users-dashboard.netlify.app/):-
A website where users can search for any GitHub user and get the details like the number of followers, following, repositories, gist, etc. Users can also see the most used language, top five most starred repositories, top five most forked repositories, etc. I have developed this project using ReactJS and GitHub API.

[Movieocity](https://movieocity.netlify.app/):-
Developed a movie dashboard website on which users can search for a movie and get similar movies according to the watched movie. It also shows trending movies, watched movies, and recommended movies. This website is developed in ReactJS and using TMDB API.

## My personal Upptime Status Website

Here is the [link](https://nishidhjain.github.io/upptime-repo/) to visit my personal Upptime status website.

## Ideas

Following are the new ideas, I would like to suggest :

- Improving the UI of the status page.
- For the demonstration purpose, I have created a web page to showcase one of the modern User Interface of the status page.
- Here is the [link](https://nishidhjain.github.io/upptime-demo/) to the demo.
- Creating a button 'Add New Website' on the status page
  - Creating this button will help the user to directly add the website from the status page and so, the user would not have to navigate to the '.upptimerc.yml' file for adding a new website for monitoring.
- Adding the search bar feature
  - If the user wants to check the status of any website for once, he/she can search for that website and get the result. Also, adding a button named 'Add To List' in the status result can help the user if he/she wants to monitor the status of the website in the future. So, this button will add the website data to the '.upptimerc.yml file. Also, selecting a background color according to the status of the website (red for down and green for up) will give better visualization to the user.

## Issues

Following are the list of issues I have seen on the homepage of upptime website:

- Header of the Upptime homepage breaks at some breakpoints [Issue #345](https://github.com/upptime/upptime/issues/345)
  - This issue can be solved by changing the breakpoint at which the navbar changes to the sidebar.
- Hero section of homepage breaks on mobile screen due to button overflow [Issue #363](https://github.com/upptime/upptime/issues/363)
  - This issue can be solved by bringing the button one below another for the mobile screen.
- The text above the iframe gets hidden on mobile devices [Issue #363](https://github.com/upptime/upptime/issues/363)
  - Changing the value of margin-bottom of the element with class '.real' will solve this issue.

I plan to address and solve all these issues and also any other issues that appear.
