Praveen's Application to the Upptime GitHub Externship

My name is Praveen and I am a beginner web dev, currently known languanges are HTML, CSS. The
reason I applied for this externship is I would like to learn Javascript, React, node.js,typescript.
Projects help me learn and build experience. I am at my best when doing projects instead of tutorials
as the probelm solving is done by myself. Looking forward to work with you.
