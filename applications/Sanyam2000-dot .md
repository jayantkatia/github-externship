# Sanyam's application to the Upptime GitHub Externship

## Introduction

Hello Upptime! This is Sanyam Mehendiratta currently pursuing Btech from UPES Dehradun and an open source enthusiast. I am experienced with HTML/CSS, Javascript, ReactJS, MongoDB, NodeJS, and github REST APIs. Moreover I'm good with flutter and I have a video tutorial up on youtube(https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkrbXtTt7qJaHuNibvMCyOA) about that. I have used all these technologies in my personal projects as well as for making open source contributions. I'm not familiar with Typescript and Svelte framework but would love to learn them on the go and implement them.

## Ideas

I have started reading the docs and playing with the code. After going through the issues, I am comfortable working on the following:

- Responsiveness: button overflow at x-axis & image hiding the text #363
- Navbar become two #345

Moreover I would love to implement few features that are in my mind including:

- For the graphs we are currently using graph.js but I think Plotly or D3 will be the better option
- A better UI for the 404 page
- And an overall improvent in the UI which includes adding more theme on the client side.

## Breakthroughs

Week 1

- Setting up the codebase and understanding the code.
- Discussion with mentor if some doubt arises.

Week 2-4

- Start working on the assigned issues.

Week 5-6

- Work on suggested changes by the mentor after the pr review.
- Meeting all the suggested changes and once again asking mentor to review the pr.

Week 6-10

- Repeating all the process till we get the desired code that is needed.

Week 11

- Complete all the pending task if any.
- Refactoring the code and start writing the documentation.

Week 12

- Documentation continue

## Commitment

I will be able to commit 20-30 hours per week or more if needed to complete the assigned task as my summer break will be there.
