# Saurav's application to the Upptime GitHub Externship

Hello, world! My name is Saurav and I want to apply to this externship because this is the first time i came accross the idea of upptime and it seems very interesting to work on. This seems like a perfect project for me to start with open sourcing as the tech requirements are the ones i am familiar with. I loved the current docs and the dark mode of the site. Few ideas /suggestions :

1. The example websites does not support dark mode as of now which is something can be worked on.
2. The status page ui can be changed for better understanding of the product to general crowd as the ui is github inspired and doesnot click everyone at a glance.
3. In dark mode the home page svgs are not visible due to contrast issues mainly.

These are the issues i noticed and want to work on these issues and would think of more features to implement. I can commit 3-4 hours a day on this project
