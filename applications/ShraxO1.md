# Shray's application to the Upptime GitHub Externship

Hello, world! My name is Shray and I want to apply to this externship because I want to acquire a new skill set and expand my field of knowledge. Secondly, I love working and meeting people from around the globe. Working on projects gives me immense joy. And this externship will help me achieve my goals. 

I have experience in Javascript, React JS, CSS, HTML. So, will help with my skills wherever necessary and improve on some existing features. I will commit 40hrs/week for this program.
