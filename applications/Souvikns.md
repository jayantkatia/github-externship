## Souvik's application to the Upptime Github Externship

Hi, I am Souvik, I am third year undergraduate pursuing my BTech in computer science from Chandigarh University. My semester will end at 28 may following with semester holiday, giving my enough time to work on Upptime project. If I am selected I would be able to work around 20-30 hrs a week on the project, also during the my semester holiday that is around june I would be able to work full time. 


## Would like to work on  
I have gone through the codebase and now I have a general idea of where everything is and how it is working. I was checking the discussions for some feature request that users want. 

### Ideas from discussion

- [RSS feed](https://github.com/upptime/upptime/discussions/275)
- [Websocket support](https://github.com/upptime/upptime/discussions/290)
- [making discord notifications look better](https://github.com/upptime/upptime/discussions/206)
- [twitter](https://github.com/upptime/upptime/discussions/350)

Will also love to work on fixing any existing bugs as well. 

## Abstract Idea for making discord Idea look better. 
I had started working on this. I opened an issue for bringing the idea from the discussion. Will start working on it after clarification from. @AnandChowdhary.

## Timeline 
#### Community Bonding 
I have already gotten accuainted with the existing codebase, in community bonding period I will learn the coding practices and procedure to submit code.

Understand all the features or bugs that I am gonna work on and create my goals. Will communicate with team and understand their vision for the changes. 

**Week 2-5** 

Have a mid-term review and making sure project is headed in the right direction with right pace.
