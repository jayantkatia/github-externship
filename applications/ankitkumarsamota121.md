## Ankit's application to the Upptime GitHub Externship

Hi, I am Ankit, currently pursuing by B.Tech. from NIT Rourkela. I am primarily a MERN Stack developer and I have experience working with HTML/CSS/JS, ReactJS , TypeScript, NodeJS, GraphQL, Gatsby, NextJS and REST APIs. I wish to pursue this externship opportunity to evaluate my inherent abilities and potential. I If I am selected, I can work on the project for 25-30 hours per week.

## What I would like to work on?

I would like to work on the Upptime website, Upptime monitor and Upptime status page. Here are a few ideas...

1. ### Upptime Website

   Building a custom website for Upptime using NextJS/Gatsby and Typescript. The website will include tutorials and code-snippets to help user in understanding the workflow of Upptime and how they can use it. References - [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

2. ### Twitter Posts
   I came across this idea in the discussions tab. The idea is to enable users to directly post a tweet if the website is down and this will help the users in reaching out to their customers quickly and keeping them updated.
3. ### Client-Side themes
   There can be an option to change the themes directly from the client side page to have better user experience.

Further I would like to work on other features suggested by others. I would also like to work on resolving issues and gaining real-world experience by working on a large scale project.
