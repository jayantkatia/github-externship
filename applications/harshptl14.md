# Harsh's application to the Upptime GitHub Externship

## About myself :construction_worker:
Hey there, my name is Harsh and I'm a third-year Computer Engineer student at Charotar University of Science and Technology, Gujarat.

In these recent years, I have been working on Web and Application development and worked on multiple [projects](https://patelharsh.gq) using technologies like Native Android, Flutter, React, Firebase, Node,
Figma etc.

I have previously [maintained](https://github.com/clubgamma/RiddlesWorld) and contributed to open-source projects under the club gamma organization during Hacktoberfest.

## Regarding Upptime :zap:

After seeing upptime under koj, I have fascinated by it because of how easily one can set up the status page of their website using it, and I really want to improve its experience even more
by contributing to it. I shall be work 25-30 hr a week if I get selected.

I have gone through the docs and also set up the project in my local machine to dive deeper. I have also implemented 
[collegespace-upptime](https://harshptl14.github.io/collegespace-upptime/) on my existing project [collegespace](https://github.com/harshptl14/collegespace/).

## New Ideas for upptime :bulb:

#### These are the ideas on which I ‚ù§ to work!
- ***More Interactive graphs üìà,*** by adding hover effects and adding support for (24h 7d 30d 1y all) in detailed page which is also discussed [here](https://github.com/upptime/upptime/issues/264)
- ***Additional information üìã,*** by adding website down history and the brief reason of it in the detail page of the particular website.
- ***Language support üà∂,*** by adding the feature to select country-wise language for better accessibility. 
#### _I am also open to work on existing Issues üö®!_

[@upptime](https://github.com/upptime/upptime) is a great project for the individual users and the companies themselves and I love to contribute to it and make it more accessible for them.
I would be glad if I get to be part of this project with the help of the Github Externship program.

Thank you!
