# Hritesh's application for the Upptime GitHub Externship
Hello! I'm Hritesh Sonawane, a 3rd year Engineering student majoring in Information Technology from Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues Institute of Technology, Navi Mumbai.

After reviewing the organization [Upptime](https://github.com/upptime) for a week, I liked how effectively GitHub Actions acts as the backbone for such big project!
* GitHub Actions is used as an uptime monitor
* GitHub Issues are used for incident reports
* GitHub Pages are used for the status website

The tech stack at Upptime looked very promising to me as I've been working on the listed technologies for some time now.

My proposals for Upptime are listed on the Notion page [here](https://www.notion.so/GitHub-Externship-Upptime-d216f72e54f1430cbf4aa57f4f4f51d1) to make this markdown file look cleaner.

I believe this wonderful opportunity given by [Upptime](https://github.com/upptime) through the GitHub Externship Program is a boon for Open Source Developers, wherin the community grows altogether.
