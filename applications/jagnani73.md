# Yashvardhan's application to the Upptime GitHub Externship

## Introduction

Greetings! I am Yashvardhan Jagnani, a student of SRMIST, Chennai. I have experience working with HTML/CSS/JS, ReactJS (flexible with frontend technologies, like Svelte), TypeScript, NodeJS, Static Site Generation and GitHub REST APIs . I would be able to commit 20-30 hours a week for the software.

## My Contribution

I have started familiarizing myself with the codebase. Having been through the Issues and the Discussions, Some of the things I would like to work on are:

### Existing

- [Support for OG Images](https://github.com/upptime/upptime/discussions/282)
- [Private mode](https://github.com/upptime/upptime/discussions/197)
- [Ping as a Protocol](https://github.com/upptime/upptime/discussions/339)
- [Graph update Issue](https://github.com/upptime/upptime/issues/347)
- [Double Navbar](https://github.com/upptime/upptime/issues/345)
- [Graph options for different times](https://github.com/upptime/upptime/issues/264)

### Personal

- Graph comparison for various time periods
- Slight UX improvements on the status site (adding a pointer cursor, responsiveness, new tab redirects, etc)
- `Ask Us Anything` section in the website (for queries that are not listed in FAQs)
- A `CLI` app that also has the same, but minified functionality
- More themes for the status website
- Any other Feature Request or Bug Fix

## Plan of Action

A **very** rough sketch of how I am planning to proceed with the tasks

- Week 1
  - Familiarize myself with the architechture and the repositories
  - Create a development environment
  - Understand the Contributions workflow
- Week 2-10
  - Start working on the allotted issues/features
  - Test out edge cases for a decent error-handling
- Week 11
  - **IF** free from all the bugs/features, write unit tests
  - Work on code optimisation
- Week 12
  - **IF** required, work on the documentation
  - Take in suggestions and reccomendations from the mentor/guide
  - Expand my network
