# Atharva's application to the Upptime GitHub Externship

I am a third year student pursuing B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering at Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology, Pune. My semester will complete around mid May leaving me enough time to get ready for my Upptime project. If I am selected, I shall be able to work around 20-30 hrs a week on the project, though am open to putting in more effort if the work requires.

<br />

## Why this project? ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”

I wasn't aware of companies losing ~100M of business because of downtime. Identifying downtime problems at an early stage and tackling them head-on, can be very effective. I loved how cleverly GitHub Actions is used in this whole project. GitHub Actions is as good as free computers doing tasks for you, then why not use them as a uptime monitor to track the incident reports and response time graphs? Soo simple yet elegant.

## Would like to work on ... ðŸ‘·ðŸ‘·

### Ideas from discussion ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

-   [Support for Gitlab CI](https://github.com/upptime/upptime/discussions/137)
-   [Teams notification (webhook)](https://github.com/upptime/upptime/discussions/285)
-   [Add uptime-latest.json and response-time-latest.json.](https://github.com/upptime/upptime/discussions/201)

### Personal ideas ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

-   Archive of reasons for failure
-   Kanban boards

_Coming up with cool and attention-grabbing names for the features isn't my forte :(_

#### Abstract â€• Archive of reasons for failure

Comparing two commits (one immediate before breakdown and one immediate after site is up) using [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/github/committing-changes-to-your-project/viewing-and-comparing-commits) across single or multiple branches to create a detailed report addressing the cause of breakdown. We can add labels explaining the issue, a short message explaining the flaw in the logic which led to breakdown and also show what exact changes in the src code helped to get the site back up.
The wireframe image below demonstrates how this demo incident [page](https://demo.upptime.js.org/incident/269) will look with this feature addition.

</p>

#### Abstract â€• Kanban boards

Along with issues why not use Project Kanban boards to organize your tasks? We can add cards to the project boards appropriately based on the status of the site (i.e To-do, In-progress, Done, etc). These cards can definitely help organize and prioritize the work to help get back site up faster and smoother. Cards can be derived from issues and based on the status of issues and/or website can be automated to be placed in respective categories.
This can minimize if not eliminate the use of extra project management tools like trello and bring back all the communication to one place. This can definitely help developers to work on their assigned tasks to match the deadlines.

### Existing bugs and features ðŸ•·ðŸ•·

I am also open to work on existing bugs and fix them.

<br />

## Timeline ðŸ“…ðŸ“…

#### Community bonding

Getting acquainted with the code base of Upptime and the procedure that needs to be followed to submit code and get it reviewed. Discussing with the team on what exactly needs to be the problem statement with minute details.

**Week 1** â€• Understand the relevant parts of the Upptime code base and try to figure out how the final product should look like.

**Week 2-5** â€• Begin implementation.

**Week 5-6** â€• Have a mid-term review and making sure project is headed in the right direction with right pace.

**Week 6-8** â€• Keep working on existing tasks but keeping in mind any suggestions/minor details mentioned in the review.

**Week 8-10** â€• Taking feedback from the community and iterating on the designs to improvise on use cases. Ensure code quality by adding more test cases.

**Week 10-11** â€• Work on the details and document the whole work.

**Week 12** â€• Spare week in case of some work getting delayed, in case of any emergency or otherwise.

<br />

I have a ~~big~~ huge personal inspiration to contribute to this project and see many more new fellow developers/users use this product, and you can be assured of my motivation to complete this project. And I would be glad if I could do this as a part of GitHub Externship program along with [@Upptime](https://github.com/upptime) Team.
