Hello, world! My name is Mayank Mohak, I am a Fast Learner and a Good Team Player. I have good grab on logical thinking and Data Structures Algorithms. I also do Problem Solving and make innovative projects.

I want to apply for this externship beacuse I am skilled in logic building and also acquainted with GitHub Actions and workflows. I have also worked on GitHub Actions on [link](https://github.com/sButtons/sbuttons/commits?author=mayankmohak).I also have an idea which i think can be implemented to make it better "We can check for if a particular ping is taking longer time than usual to analyse if website need to scale or by this we can pridict when it may stop."

I would love to take this oppurtunity to showcase my skills and solve real industry problems.

Time : 20+ hours/week :smiley:
