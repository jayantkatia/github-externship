# Reuben's application to the Upptime GitHub Externship 

My name is Reuben and I want to apply to this externship because I want to dive deep into the unknows of the developing world. I want to experience real world problems firsthand and find out unique and creative ways to solve these problems. I believe that this externship can provide me with such kinds of experience and knowledge. I know that I may not be upto par with other computer science students, but I believe that I have the ability to learn from my mistakes and work harder to understanding those complex problems I may face with. 
I have some experience with React and I believe that it will help me contribute to the project I will be working on, and since I managed to learn Reatc in a few weeks I think that I can be able to learn more and contirbute as much.
I believe that I can commit an average of 3-4 hours a day.
