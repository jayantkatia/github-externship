# Sakshi's application to the Upptime GitHub Externship

## Introduction

Hello there! I am Sakshi Choudhary, a student of SRMIST, Chennai and active Open source contributor. I am experienced with Javascript,Typescript,HTML/CSS, ReactJS, NextJS, Gatsby, NodeJS, NestJS and github REST APIs as I have worked with these technologies in my previous internships and I have been among the top open source contributors in one of the projects in the CodeForCause community under JBoss organisation. You can find my contributions [here](https://github.com/codeforcauseorg/edu-client/pulls?q=is%3Apr+isauthor%3Asakshi-choudhary).


## Deliverables

I have setup the code in my local machine, have been playing around with the code to familarize myself with the codebase. I have looked into the existing issues and discussion panel and also reported 1 issue. I also started to read docs and practise through [svelet.dev](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics) to get more comfortable with the svelte framework.

#### My Personal Website Upptime: https://github.com/sakshi-choudhary/my-upptime

### These are the existing issues, I would like to work on :
- [Websocket support](https://github.com/upptime/upptime/discussions/290)
- [Support for OG Images](https://github.com/upptime/upptime/discussions/282)
- [Graph update Issue](https://github.com/upptime/upptime/issues/347)
- [Double Navbar Issue](https://github.com/upptime/upptime/issues/345)
- [Add RSS Feed](https://github.com/upptime/upptime/discussions/275)
- [Graph options for different times](https://github.com/upptime/upptime/issues/264)

I would also love to work on fixing any other existing bugs as well. 

### Some features/issues I propse that I would like to work on are :
- [Responsiveness Issue](https://github.com/upptime/upptime/issues/363) (This issue is created by me, I have explained it properly in its issue page)

- <b>Graph Hover Feature</b> 
    We can show the user the value of the graph's y-axis on hovering over the graph at a particular point(time/day).
    
- An issue I faced while creating my personal website upptime: So, the status-page becomes like this while loading initially, the CSS gets weird.

    It appears like this in the beginning.

    <img width="592" alt="Screenshot 2021-05-18 at 11 51 44" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66865329/118641755-2d9d7b80-b7f8-11eb-968b-68db76539e53.png">

    and then turns to something like this slowly

    <img width="584" alt="Screenshot 2021-05-18 at 11 42 54" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66865329/118641762-2ecea880-b7f8-11eb-809b-e18201e0d952.png">

    Both the states looks bad in the loading state.

     I know there's already a discussion on this issue [here](https://github.com/upptime/upptime/discussions/89), that's why I didn't raise an issue but in my case the repository name was correct and other configurations as well but still this issue occured with me so might be some other source to this issue which I would like to work on.
  
 - Currently, we have to option to configure and set 1 theme in `.yaml` file. But It will be a better user experience if we give theme switching option to the user in the status page itself somehwere in the menu bar with a 3dot icon or something.
 
- The 404 page currently for the status-page website is an empty page with navbar and footer. For better user-experience we can make a 404 page and give an option to go back to home to the user.

    
## Milestones

Week 1          

- Setup the codebase I will spend this time brainstorming & understanding the codebase.
- Discuss with the mentor if I get some doubt while understanding the codebase.
- As I have already researched about the
  various approaches to resolve some issues, I would discuss these approaches with the mentor.
- Discuss with the mentor and Prioritise issues and features alloted to me. 

Week 2-5
- Start working on the alloted issues/features according to the priority list made.

Week 6
- Work on the code after PR reviews.
- Work on the feedback provided by the mentor.
- Request for re-review till PR gets merged.

Week 6-10
- Repeat week 2-6 (for the other half of the tasks)

Week 11
- Complete backlog (if any)
- Refactor all the code written till now (if required).

Week 12
- Write Unit Tests. 
    For tests, will need to discuss with the mentor about testing techniques to be used.
    I propose [svelte testing library](https://github.com/testing-library/svelte-testing-library) for the status page unit tests.
- Write Documentation of the whole work.



## Commitment 
I will be able to work around 25-30 hrs a week on the project in the first month and about 30-40 hrs the 2nd month onwards, as I will be having summer break.

## Communication
- I will be available on the particular discussion forum of the organisation (slack/discord) and the mail or phone call during the daytime.
- I will be regularly reporting to my mentors about the progress of the tasks and any impediments that I may encounter.
