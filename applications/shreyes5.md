# Shreyes' application to the Upptime GitHub Externship

Hi! My name is Shreyes Srivastava and I want to apply to the Upptime GitHub Externship because it is a new learning opportunity as well as a challenge for me. Contributing to open source is something that I am always fascinated about. This Externship seems like the perfect opportunity for me to contribute to the community.

# About Me

I am currently in my third year of college. I have worked with React, TypeScript and Node.js before. Having little knowledge of Nestjs, I would certainly love to know more as to how it is used in real life and learn more about it.

# My proposals for the Upptime Github Externship

- Better responsiveness for mobile devices and
- An overall better UI with, reusing more components
- Searching includes more results

# My motive

- This project uses technologies that I have worked with before and this seems like a good opportunity to explore more.
- I can dedicate around 15 hours a week to the project.
