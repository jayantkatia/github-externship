# Simranjeet's application to the Upptime GitHub Externship

Hello, world! My name is Simranjeet and I want to apply to this externship because I would like to enhance my skills and knowledge with some experience as I think required skillset is a prefect match with my profile.
I have good experience with **React(NextJs)**, **NodeJs**, Python, Firebase and **Github Actions**. I am also familliar with **Svelte** and VueJs.

## Contribution Ideas

### Chat-Bot

- Add a feature of chat-bot that can give customize updates and emergency reports to team members on their chat groups (like **slack channels** or discord groups).
- Can make use of tools such as: [slack-bot-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/slack-bot-action), [slackbot-bot-automation](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/slackbot-bot-automation)

### Security Overview

- Provide security alerts for **npm dependencies/packages**.

### Server Analytics

- Show server response time for various internet speed.
- Analysis of no. of bytes transferred to track down the **bottlenecks**.

Can help with migration from sapper to **sevelte-kit** (if required!), as Sapper is no longer in development.

I can also work on exisiting bugs/issues, and other good ideas in the discussion section.

<hr />

Looking forward to give my best to this organization.ðŸ˜ƒ
Speaking about the hours I can give **30+** hours/week for the project.
