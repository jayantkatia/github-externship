Hello, world! My name is Aman Tyagi ,I am a constant learner and keep evolving both on professional as well as personal front. Having DevOps as my major I am a Computer Science 
student with robust problem-solving skills and proven experience in the domain of computer science. I want to apply for this externship beacuse I think I have the skillset and no 
other platform and give me this oppurtunity to showcase my skills and solve real industry problems.

I feel with my experience, the type of groundbreaking work your organization has put forward, I would be able to confidently chip in the best of my knowledge in future project
for your company.

Honestly speaking I feel like I am now ready to take a bigger role & professionally handle more responsibilities.

I have always had a benchmark in my mind about my readiness to handle more responsibilities & work with larger firms, however, till now I felt I had to polish more skills to reach 
there. If given an opportunity I positively look forward to give my best to your organization. Speaking about the hours I can give 40+ hours/week for the project.	:smiley:
