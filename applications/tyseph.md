Hey, I am Sajal Ganjewala, a pre-final year computer science undergraduate, looking forward to getting into the GitHub externship program and getting hands-on experience in solving a real-world tech problem. I would love to contribute to any of the features that are required in Upptime and am ready to put in the required time and effort for the same. It would also be a great opportunity to get to know other developers, about their journey and to learn from their industry experience.
